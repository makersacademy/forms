# Forms

A common way to send data from a browser to a server
is using.

#### Task 1
Fill out each of the forms and observe what happens.
It may look similar but each form is subtly different.
Have a look at the url in the browser and the server logs.

#### Task 2
What happens when you change the value of the attribute name
in the form?
```<input name="name" type="text"></input>```

Why does this happen? How can you fix it?

#### Task 3
Can you use `http` to make the request from the command line
rather than the browser?

#### Task 4
Using this resource as a guide: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp
See if you can add in a new type of form and display the results
